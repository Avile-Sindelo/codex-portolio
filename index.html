			  	<h4> Tic Tac Toe </h4>
			  	<img src="images/shot4.png" class="project-img" alt="screenshot 1">
			  	<p>
			  		The tic tac toe game is an old 2-player game that most of us know, love and used to play pen and pad. The infamous game of X's and O's.

			  		I developed my own variant of the game, following the same old rules.
			  		Click <a href="http://www.qicqacqoe.freevar.com">here</a> and check it out. Enjoy!

			  	<h4> Yo-Kulca clothing brand </h4>
			  	<img src="images/shot6.png" class="project-img" alt="screenshot 2">
			  	<p>
			  		A website that showcases a Mthatha-based local clothing brand, Yo-Kulca, established by its young founder and CEO Yonga Mahlamvu in 2019. </br></br>

			  		The brand is locally well-known for its unique and gorgeous designs, that really are just great ideas that have been brought to life by the head designer, Yanga Ndabisa. </br>

			  		Click <a href="http://www.yokulca.freevar.com">here</a> and check out their description, catelogue, location and contact.

			  	<h4> The Pig Game </h4>
			  	<img src="images/shot5.png" class="project-img" alt="screenshot 3">
			  	<p>
			  		Another 2-player game of dice.</br>
			  		Each player can ROLL a die multiple times, accumulating a current score, and can then HOLD. Upon Holding, the current score gets added to the player's global score, and its the next player's turn. </br>
			  		If you happen to roll a 1 in your multiple rolls though, you lose all your current score and its immediately the next player's turn.</br>

			  		The player whose GLOBAL score gets to 100 first, wins the game.</br></br>
			  		Please find a opponent and click <a href="http://www.piggame.freevar.com">here</a> to play my game, you'll barely regret it and I'd highly appreciate you playing it and taking your time to suggest whatever changes or additions you might think of, we might work on that.
